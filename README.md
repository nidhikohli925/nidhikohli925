## Hi I am Nidhi Sehgal ðŸ‘‹

With a background in dentistry and a passion for problem-solving, Iâ€™m transitioning into data analytics to bridge the gap between healthcare and technology. I enjoy transforming data into clear insights that support evidence-based decisions. Currently developing strong skills in Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau to tell meaningful stories through data.
